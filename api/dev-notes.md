#Sheldon API
See `Dev/Dev-Node/sheldonapi/` for development version. Do all development work there.
When copying files from there to the app_files folder here, don't include the node_modules folder or the `package-lock.json` file.
After each copy, you'll need to rebuild the image by CDing into the `api` folder and using the `build` script.
